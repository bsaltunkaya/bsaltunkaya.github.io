I hope to learn some HTML and other trickery to create this simple blog to include all my details.

You can check my Github profile in the meantime, see my cool projects for yourself. :)

This page is licensed under GNU GPL 3, which means you can essentially do whatever you want with the contents of this webpage
-obviously ones with a different license in their responsible repo pages aside- **except release closed source versions of it**.

As long as you use them in open source projects it's fine, even though you make money off of it!
